Face Emotion Recognition Using Machine Learning | Python

This project is a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize emotions from facial expressions. 
It employs various algorithms to analyze and interpret facial features, allowing it to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. 
The project likely involves training a model on a dataset of labeled facial expressions, and then implementing the trained model to make predictions on new images or video streams.
